================================================================================
Generated: 2025-11-11
Data Source: Avanzamento_schede_automated.xlsx
Items Analyzed: 87

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Based on the analysis of 87 completed items, your team's delivery performance
shows a balanced distribution with significant room for improvement:

- Performance Score: 66.7% items delivered on-time or early
- 33.3% items delivered late - requiring attention
- Average delay: 10 days across all items
- High variability: Standard deviation of 35.1 days indicates inconsistent
  performance

================================================================================
PERFORMANCE DISTRIBUTION
================================================================================

Category            Count    Percentage    Status
-------------------------------------------------
Early (Delta < 0)     29       33.3%       GOOD - Delivered before deadline
On-time (Delta = 0)   29       33.3%       PERFECT - Exactly on schedule
Late (Delta > 0)      29       33.3%       NEEDS ATTENTION - Exceeded deadline

INSIGHT: Perfect three-way split suggests systematic issues rather than random
variation. This indicates that delays are not isolated incidents but may be
related to planning, resource allocation, or estimation accuracy.

================================================================================
KEY STATISTICS
================================================================================

Delta Statistics (days):
  Average:      10.0 days
  Median:        0.0 days
  Std Dev:      35.1 days
  Min:        -108 days (best: earliest delivery - MCB_Q30_0031)
  Max:        +145 days (worst: most delayed - ACC_2025_0107)

INTERPRETATION:
The median of 0 days suggests that half of all items meet their deadline
exactly or better. However, the mean of +10 days indicates that outliers
(very late items) significantly pull the average up. The high standard
deviation (35.1 days) reveals inconsistent performance across projects.

Performance Score: 66.7% delivered on-time or early
This means 2 out of every 3 items meet expectations, but 1 in 3 exceeds
the promised deadline.

2025-11    -108 days    1     100.0%    EXCELLENT    Low

CRITICAL INSIGHTS FROM MONTHLY TRENDS:

1. EARLY 2025 CRISIS (April-June):
   - 0% on-time delivery for 9 items across 3 months
   - Average delays ranging from 47 to 119 days
   - All items failed to meet deadlines

   POSSIBLE ROOT CAUSES:
   - Unrealistic planning/promises made in Q1 2025
   - Resource constraints or capacity issues
   - Major process or system changes
   - External supply chain disruptions
   - Inadequate risk buffers in estimates

2. MID-2025 RECOVERY (July-September):
   - Dramatic improvement starting July
   - On-time rate progression: 67.7% → 81.8% → 77.1%
   - Average delta improved from +119 days to -1 days
   - Volume increased significantly (31-35 items/month in Jul & Sep)

   SUCCESS FACTORS TO INVESTIGATE:
   - Process improvements implemented?
   - Better resource allocation?
   - More realistic planning?
   - Team learning from Q2 failures?
   - New project management tools or methods?

3. CURRENT PERFORMANCE (September 2025):
   - 35 items completed (highest volume month)
   - 77.1% on-time or early delivery rate
   - Slight average early delivery (-1 day)
   - Sustainable performance level appears established

   SUSTAINABILITY CONCERNS:
   - Can this performance level be maintained?
   - Is high volume (35 items) putting pressure on quality?
   - Are we seeing regression to mean or true improvement?

4. VOLUME VS QUALITY CORRELATION:
   - Q2 2025: Low volume (2-4 items), 0% on-time
   - Q3 2025: High volume (11-35 items), 67-82% on-time
   - INSIGHT: Higher volume correlates with better performance
     This suggests Q2 may have had systemic issues unrelated to capacity

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE:
Your team demonstrates 66.7% on-time performance with a significant
improvement trend from Q2 to Q3 2025. The dramatic recovery from 0%
(Q2) to 77-82% (Aug-Sep) shows the team is capable of good performance.

KEY STRENGTHS:
- Recent months show sustained 77-82% on-time rate
- Team can deliver early (29 items ahead of schedule)
- High volume (35 items/month) handled successfully in September
- Clear upward trajectory after Q2 crisis

CRITICAL CONCERNS:
- One in three items still misses deadlines
- Four items delayed by 4+ months (customer relationship risk)
- High variability (35-day SD) indicates unpredictability
- Q2 2025 systemic failure needs thorough investigation

TARGET STATE:
80%+ on-time performance with <20 days standard deviation, achieved
through systematic process improvements and elimination of extreme outliers.

PATH FORWARD:
1. Investigate and resolve the four critical delays (125-145 days late)
2. Understand what caused Q2 2025's 0% on-time rate
3. Replicate Q3 2025 success factors across all projects
4. Reduce variance through standardization and early intervention
5. Build sustainable excellence through continuous improvement

NEXT REVIEW:
Monitor monthly trends through October-November 2025. If September's
77% performance sustains for two more months, the team will have
established a stable "new normal" at industry-average performance levels,
with clear pathway to good (85%+) performance.

BOTTOM LINE:
The data shows a team in recovery with proven capability for good
performance. The challenge now is to sustain Q3's improvement, eliminate
extreme outliers, and build consistency. With focused effort on the
recommendations above, achieving 80%+ on-time delivery within 3-6 months
is a realistic and achievable goal.
